OseerArt (also known as TraceAR) is an Augmented Reality mobile application designed to help deaf and hard-of-hearing learners (and anyone who wants to improve their drawing skills) by overlaying traceable sketches onto real-world surfaces using a phone camera.
The app uses Unity’s AR Foundation to anchor sketches onto paper or flat surfaces, allowing users to trace over them easily.
Users can explore multiple categories of sketches — Nature, Animals, Architecture, and Sculptures — and interact with them using gestures to scale, move, and rotate the overlays in AR space.

**Key Features**

AR Sketch Projection — overlay reference sketches onto paper using the camera.

Category Selection — choose from Nature, Animals, Architecture, or Sculptures.

Dynamic Loading — load sketches from categorized folders dynamically.

Gesture Controls — pinch to zoom, rotate, or reposition the sketch overlay.

Accessible UI — designed for deaf and hard-of-hearing users with visual cues and clean layouts.

Dark Mode — adaptive dark/light themes for user comfort.
